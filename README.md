## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose person
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose("young prince")
"Would you take this rose, #{young prince}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
town.residents.delete_at(1)
town.castle.guests << "Belle"
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each do |friend|
  puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## TDD and RSpec

### Question 4

Describe the differences between unit and functional testing. What type of testing is RSpec and why?

Your answer:
```text
RSpec is unit testing. Unit testing tests each piece or unit of your code, versus functional testing which tests overall if your code works. With unit testing, it's easier to narrow down a problem within your code.
```

### Question 5

Using the following RSpec test as an example, explain the differences between `describe` and `context`:

```ruby
describe Apartment do
  describe "#add_tenant" do
    subject(:apartment) do
      apartment = Apartment.create(num_beds: 3)
      # we start with 2 tenants (3 bedrooms)
      apartment.add_tenant("alice")
      apartment.add_tenant("bob")
      apartment # return the apartment
    end

    context "when there is room (<= the number of beds)" do
      it "adds a tenant" do
        apartment.add_tenant("Third tenant")
        expect(apartment.tenants.count).to eq(3)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Your answer:
```text
Functionally there is no difference between describe and context. Using context helps with readability when there is branching login in your  code, i.e., when theres is a new context of your describe.
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 6

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
Entity relationship diagram - describes the relationships between different pieces of data in a database. A lamp has a Genie and a Genie belongs to that lamp. A person can have multiple pets and a pet belongs to that person.
```

### Question 7

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema is used to create tables and designate the columns within them. You represent a one-to-many relationship by putting the id of the 'one' part of the relationship into the data values for the 'many' table (foreign id). The wishes table would include person_id as a data value.
```

### Question 8

**Assume:**  

1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.  
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.  
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.  
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.  

**Write code to do the following:**

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
genie = Genie.create(name:"Genie")
lamp = Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3, genie: genie)
lamp.update(wishes_remaining: 1)
jafar = Genie.create(name: "Jafar")
Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3, genie: jafar)
genie.update(lamp: nil)
```
