## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose person
    puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose "young prince"
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
town[:castle][:guests] << town[:residents].delete("Belle")
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each do |friend|
    puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## TDD and RSpec

### Question 4

Describe the differences between unit and functional testing. What type of testing is RSpec and why?

Your answer:
```text

Unit tests check the smallest level, i.e. the functionality of a specific method. In general, unit tests should
not be more than 5 lines long. Functional tests have a much wider focus, testing the functionality of entire features,
which might involve running code covered by many individual unit tests.

I would argue RSpec is designed to perform unit tests, but when enough tests are combined into a single spec, it can have
the effect of functional testing.
```

### Question 5

Using the following RSpec test as an example, explain the differences between `describe` and `context`:

```ruby
describe Apartment do
  describe "#add_tenant" do
    subject(:apartment) do
      apartment = Apartment.create(num_beds: 3)
      # we start with 2 tenants (3 bedrooms)
      apartment.add_tenant("alice")
      apartment.add_tenant("bob")
      apartment # return the apartment
    end

    context "when there is room (<= the number of beds)" do
      it "adds a tenant" do
        apartment.add_tenant("Third tenant")
        expect(apartment.tenants.count).to eq(3)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Your answer:
```text

Context and describe are functionally equivalent, but context is used specifically to nest tests within each other.
TBH, I'm not sure how well this applies to the preceding example, but you could use context tags to test different
units that make of different "branches" of the same shared "tree."
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 6

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
Entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) are tools used to visualize and describe the data relating to the major
entities that exist in programs. Creating an ERD assists the planning out and creation of a database table structure.

Presumably, a genie and a lamp would have a one-to-one relationship. The lamp would have attributes like size, gleam,
and how many times to rub it (that's what she said), while the genie would have his/her own attributes. Each genie has one-to-one
lamp and vice versa.

On the other hand, each person may have many pets, and a pet may have many people (e.g. family dog).
```

### Question 7

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema is a SQL file that allows you to import database tables and columns/attributes quickly (and repeatedly, if necessary).
In a one-to-many relationship, the table containing the "many" elements would include a foreign key column which equals the
primary ID of the "one" elements.
```

### Question 8

**Assume:**  

1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.  
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.  
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.  
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.  

**Write code to do the following:**

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
lamp = Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3)
genie = Genie.create("Genie")
lamp.update(genie.id: genie)
jafar = Genie.create("Jafar")
lamp2 = Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3, genie.id: jafar)
lamp = nil
```
