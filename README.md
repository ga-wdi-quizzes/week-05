## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose(person)
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end
offer_rose("young prince")

```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
belle = town[:residents].delete("Belle")
town[:castle][:guests].push(belle)
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]

friends.each do |friend|
   puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## TDD and RSpec

### Question 4

Describe the differences between unit and functional testing. What type of testing is RSpec and why?

Your answer:
```text

Unit testing is usually for programmers and tests the smallest units of
individual code, usually methods, to be certain they operate correctly.

Functional testing is for users, tests larger units of code, and is meant to
ensure that the code produces the correct outputs from the test inputs and
meets the business requirements it's meant to satisfy.
```

### Question 5

Using the following RSpec test as an example, explain the differences between `describe` and `context`:

```ruby
describe Apartment do
  describe "#add_tenant" do
    subject(:apartment) do
      apartment = Apartment.create(num_beds: 3)
      # we start with 2 tenants (3 bedrooms)
      apartment.add_tenant("alice")
      apartment.add_tenant("bob")
      apartment # return the apartment
    end

    context "when there is room (<= the number of beds)" do
      it "adds a tenant" do
        apartment.add_tenant("Third tenant")
        expect(apartment.tenants.count).to eq(3)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Your answer:
```text

"Describe" refers to the functionality/method being tested.  "Context" describes the
state in which that functionality is to be tested.  In this case, the
functionality is "add tenant", the context here tests that functionality when
there is an open bed available.  The next context to be tested might be a
situation where all 3 rooms are full and there is no room for another tenant.

```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 6

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
ERD stands for Entity Relationship Diagram, and is used to show how two
entities are related.  In the context of databases, they are used to display
how tables relate to one another.  In this example, a person table would have
rows for individual people and the pets table rows for individual pets.  Since
a person can have multiple pets, the tables would be connected by one-to many
relationships between individual rows in the people table to one or more rows
in the pets table.  
```

### Question 7

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema is a description of the entire configuration of a database, including
tables, relations, indexes, constraints, triggers, etc.  Data relationships are
shown by lines/arrows drawn between tables.  One-to-one relationships are
drawn with a line that ends with a single arrow (->), while a one-to-many
relationship is indicated by a line ending in something shaped more like a fork
(−∈).
```

### Question 8

**Assume:**  

1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.  
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.  
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.  
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.  

**Write code to do the following:**

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
1.  Lamp.create(name: "Genie")
    Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3)
2.  ????
3.  Lamp.find_by(genie: "Genie")
    Lamp.update(wishes_remaining: 1)
4.  jafar = Genie.create(name: "Jafar")
    jafar_lamp = Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3)
5   genie.update(lamp: nil)
```
