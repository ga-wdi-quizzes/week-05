## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose person
  @person = person
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose "Young Prince"
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
belle = town[:residents].delete "Belle"
town[:castle][:guests].push belle
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each do |friend|
  puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## TDD and RSpec

### Question 4

Describe the differences between unit and functional testing. What type of testing is RSpec and why?

Your answer:
```text
Unit testing tests individual methods or functions, while functional testing tests functionality of several interactions.  RSpec is considered unit testing since it checks the smallest level possible.
```

### Question 5

Using the following RSpec test as an example, explain the differences between `describe` and `context`:

```ruby
describe Apartment do
  describe "#add_tenant" do
    subject(:apartment) do
      apartment = Apartment.create(num_beds: 3)
      # we start with 2 tenants (3 bedrooms)
      apartment.add_tenant("alice")
      apartment.add_tenant("bob")
      apartment # return the apartment
    end

    context "when there is room (<= the number of beds)" do
      it "adds a tenant" do
        apartment.add_tenant("Third tenant")
        expect(apartment.tenants.count).to eq(3)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Your answer:
```text
Functionally there is not much difference, the difference is mainly in regards to readability.  Context is being used to specify certain conditions within a method while describe is specifying the entire method being tested.
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 6

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD, or Entity Relationship Diagram, shows how different aspects of a database relate.  This is helpful for understanding the potentially large amount of information in a database.

Genie
-name
-has a Lamp
-wishes left
Lamp
-material
-belongs to a Genie
Person
-name
-has many wishes
Pet
-name
-species
-belongs to a Person

```

### Question 7

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
Schemas define what tables go in a database and how the database should be structured.

Person
-primary key
-name
wishes
-primary key
-person id
-text of wish
```

### Question 8

**Assume:**  

1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.  
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.  
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.  
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.  

**Write code to do the following:**

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
genie = Genie.create(name: "Genie")
lamp = Lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3)
lamp.update(genie: genie)
lamp.update(wishes_remaining: 1)
jafar = Genie.create(name: "Jafar")
lamp_two = Lamp.creat(wishes_remaining: 3)
lamp_two.update(genie: jafar)
lamp.update(genie: nil)
```
