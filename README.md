## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offerRose`, which should take one argument named person.

When called, the method should `puts`, "Would you take this rose and help out
an old beggar, X?", where X is the person passed into the method.

Demonstrate calling the method with an argument of "young prince".

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offerRose (person)
  puts "Would you take this rose and help out an old beggar, #{person}?"
end

offerRose("Young Prince")
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}

town[:residents].delete_if{|name| name == "Belle"}

town[:castle][:guests] << "Belle"
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]

friends.each do |friend|
  puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## TDD and RSpec

### Question 4

Describe the differences between unit and functional testing. What type of testing is RSpec and why?

Your answer:
```text
Unit tests are testing one particular element of the functionality as you go along. For example, testing using a puts statement to return the value in Pry. Functional testing are in-depth testing that confirms that the system does what it is expected to, and that something that was once working is not being broken by new code that has been added. RSpec is functional testing as it tests many different elements of the functionality at once and returns whether each test was a success or failure.
```

### Question 5

Using the following RSpec test as an example, explain the differences between `describe` and `context`:

```ruby
describe Apartment do
  describe "#add_tenant" do
    subject(:apartment) do
      apartment = Apartment.create(num_beds: 3)
      # we start with 2 tenants (3 bedrooms)
      apartment.add_tenant("alice")
      apartment.add_tenant("bob")
      apartment # return the apartment
    end

    context "when there is room (<= the number of beds)" do
      it "adds a tenant" do
        apartment.add_tenant("Third tenant")
        expect(apartment.tenants.count).to eq(3)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Your answer:
```text
Describe is a way of declaring that you the tests it contains are related to the "add_tenant" method within the Apartment class. Context explains the particular scenario that you will be testing within the method--in this case, if there is extra room in the apartment the method should add a tenant to equal 3.
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 6

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
<!-- Maybe clarify whether they're meant to give relationships between all four entities or... -->
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD is an entity relationship document. These are important because they help to establish the connections that all the different elements of the database will have to each other (what tables will be connected to one another, etc.).

A genie can't exist without a lamp, so the genie would have an arrow pointing to the lamp. The lamp would have an arrow pointing to the person, who would rub the lamp to release the genie. The pet would likely not have any integration with the other three items in the database.
```

### Question 7

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema details all the different characteristics that each table will have. We represent a one-to-many relationship by adding ' t.integer "person" ' to the wishes schema. This means that each wish belongs to one person, but a single person can have many wishes.

```

### Question 8

**Assume:**
1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.
<!-- Do we want to specifiy what kind of relationship they have, in case some students aren't familiar with the mythology...? -->
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.

Write code to do the following:

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
class Lamp < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :genies
end

class Genie < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :lamp
end

lamp1 = lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3, id: 1)
genie = genie.create(name: "Genie", lamp_id: 1)
lamp1.update(wishes_remaining: 1)
lamp2 = lamp.create(wishes_remaining: 3, id: 2)
jafar = genie.create(name: "Jafar", lamp_id: 2)
genie.update(lamp_id: nil)
```
